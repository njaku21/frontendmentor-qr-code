## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I am just a backend developer doing projects to get more comfortable with frontend UI design without always relying on Bootstrap etc. I am still getting more comfortable with CSS grid and flexbox.

### Useful resources

- Ask ChatGPT to give you simple examples of the things you want to create. Ask it to use Bootstrap if you want to learn about framework usage. GPT-4 does a phenomenal job at helping you get a baseline to dissect that isn't overwhelming.
